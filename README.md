# Documenting APIs

GBADs Informatics aims to be a data broker. This means that when possible, we will set up streams of data through our Knowledge Engine, communicating with other data sources to call data to GBADs users. We do this through APIs. Of course, this all starts with us having a thorough understanding of how the APIs of interest work, how we can get the data from them, and how this all will fit into our own system's architecture. 

**Here, we document relevant APIs in Jupyter notebooks.**
